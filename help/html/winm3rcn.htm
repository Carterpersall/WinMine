<P>Minesweeper is a challenging game of strategy and luck.  You are presented with a mine field, and your objective is to locate all the mines as quickly as possible.  To accomplish this task, you have two tools:  one is a mine detector, the other is your foot.</P>

<P>In order to locate the mines using these limited tools, use the following approach:  </P>

<P>1Step on a square with your foot.</P>

<P>2If the square is a mine, you're dead.</P>

<P>3If the square isn't a mine, your mine detector informs you of the number of mines in the surrounding eight squares.  </P>

<P>Continue to step on squares until you either uncover all the squares without mines and win or step on a mine and die.</P>

<P>You can use the counters at the top of the playing area to keep track of your progress.</P>

<P>The counter in the upper-left corner of the playing area initially indicates the number of mines hidden in the mine field.  Every time you <A HREF="winm13vv.htm">mark</A> a square, this number decreases by one.</P>

<P>The counter in the upper-right corner of the playing area is a timer, which displays your playing time in seconds.  The faster you find all the mines, the better your score.</P>
