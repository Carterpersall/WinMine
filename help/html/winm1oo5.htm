<P><B>Minesweeper Rules:</B></P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bull.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>The playing area is a mine field, simulated by a grid of squares.  Initially, all the squares are covered.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/covered.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>A covered square</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bull.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>To uncover a square, you step on it.  You continue to uncover squares until only the squares containing mines are covered.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bull.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>If you step on a square that contains a mine, the game is over and all the mines are displayed.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/mine.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>A mine square</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bull.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>If you step on a square that does not contain a mine, it is replaced by either a number or a blank.  If the square is replaced by a number, <I>N</I>, then there are <I>N</I> mines in the surrounding eight squares.  If the square is replaced by a blank, there are no mines in the surrounding eight squares.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/blank.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>A blank square</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/num.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>A number square</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/number.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>Here, there are three mines in the surrounding eight squares.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bull.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>If you step on a square, and it is replaced by a blank, the surrounding eight squares are uncovered automatically because there cannot be any mines under them.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bull.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>If you know a square is a mine, you can <A HREF="winm13vv.htm">mark</A> the square.  You cannot step on a marked square.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/marked.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>A marked square</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bull.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>You can also clear around an uncovered number square.  Clearing around an uncovered number square uncovers any of the surrounding eight squares which are unmarked. </P>

<P>Note:  You are not allowed to clear around a square if you have not marked enough mines in the surrounding eight squares, or if the square is covered.  For example, if you try to clear around a square labeled 3, and you have marked only two squares with mines, nothing will happen.  Or, if you try to clear around an uncovered square, nothing will happen.  </P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/befbs.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>If you clear around the center square . . . </P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/aftbs.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> . . . the surrounding unmarked squares are uncovered.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bull.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>If you clear around an uncovered number square, and there is an unmarked mine in the surrounding eight squares, it is uncovered and the game is over.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/befbsm.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>Here, if you clear around the center square . . .</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/aftbsm.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> . . . a mine is uncovered and the game is over.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bull.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>Play continues until you either uncover all squares without mines or until you uncover a mine and die.</P>
